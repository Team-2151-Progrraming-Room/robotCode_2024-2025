List of subsystem we will have:
- DriveTrainSubsystem
  - Swerve modules (4) each including
    - Drive motor
    - Steer motor
    - CANcoder for steering angle
  - Pigeon IMU
  - Connected to roboRIO using CANivore so all drivetrain motors and sensors are on a high speed CAN FD bus
- ArmSubsystem
  - Controls movement of the arm
    - Algae manipulation
    - Climbing
  - Motors
    - Pair of motors driving arm position and holding position as needed
    - Leader / follower?
  - Sensors
    - Angular position of arm
      - Where will we measure this from?
      - How will we zero this encoder so we know the starting position?
    - Cage engaged for climbing sensor?  Meaning we've contacted the top side of the cage bottom - is visual enough?
    - Are there specific positions we need to be able to reach and maintain?
      - Floor pickup
      - Processor scoring
      - Low reef algae removal
      - High reef algae removal
      - Net shooting
      - Others?
    - How does this subsystem interact with other subsystems?
      - Commands for example
- CoralSubsystem
  - Would handle coral intake and drop off - since the coral is dropped in passively from the loading station we really just need the motor to score it
  - Motors
    - Single motor - most likely
    - Is PID functionality needed for this application?
      - Why or why not?
  - Sensors
    - Detect coral loaded?  Not even sure we need this as our coral loading is all passive from the loading station
  - How does this subsystem interact with other subsystems?
    - Commands for example
- AlgaeShooterSubsystem
  - Algae floor pickup, reef removal, processor drop off, and shooting into the barge
  - Motors
    - Two intake / shooting motors driving upper and lower rollers
      - Independently controlled?
      - Why or why not?
    - Single motor for algae retention and to feed into shooting rollers
      - How will this interact with the intake / shooting motors?
      - How will the code handle that?
  - Sensors
    - Algae loaded sensor?
    - What happens if we don't get a sensor for this condition?
  - How does this subsystem interact with other subsystems?
    - Commands for example
- ClimbLockSubsystem
  - Engages cage locks to secure arm to cage
  - Motors
    - Single DC motor with attached gearbox to rotate cage locks into locked position
  - Sensors
    - Encoder on lock motor to measure lock rotation from full open
  - Other considerations
    - Stalls at lock position
    - May need to reduce current limit from active closing current limit
  - Other subsystem interactions
    - Works as part of the climb sequence
    - Requires some specific arm orientations to grab and engage with the cage
      - Starting orientation
        - We'll have to empirically figure out the angle
      - Lock
      - Climb
        - Not a separate "subsystem but a combined effort
          - Arm position
          - Cage locking
        - Effectively "lowering" the arm which will pull the robot up
          - Can we define an arm limit for this to prevent potential robot damage?  Do we have to?
          - Can we just "climb" by lowering the arm to it's lowest position?
- LEDSubsystem
  - Lights to help indicate different things on the robot + help us stay in the game
  - What functionality is needed?
  - What states do we want to indicate:
    - List them here...
    - What will the look like to the operator?
- VisionSubsystem
  - Help us to navigate the field
